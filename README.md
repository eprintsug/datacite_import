# datacite_import
A plugin for importing DOIs from DataCite.

This is the initial development for a plugin to allow DOIs to be imported from DataCite where it is metadata authority rather than CrossRef. This initially development is based on DataCite's current (v4.4) metadata schema and uses the JSON API available at *https://api.datacite.org/dois/__DOI__*. However, extensive testing and further development will still be full required to support v4.4 and earlier versions of the DataCite metadata schema.
